# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset that includes various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, and more. The project involves data collection, data exploration and visualization, feature engineering, and model development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. The project also requires the following Python libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib sklearn
```

### Installing

Clone the repo to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git

### Navigate to the project directory: 

cd your_repo

### Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb

## Running the tests
The project includes tests for the models developed. The performance of the models is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
